\chapter{Simulated comparisons of QNNs}
\label{chap:comparison}

To see if quantum machine learning is indeed a viable alternative to classical machine learning, some empirical comparisons are in order.
In this chapter, three quantum neural networks are implemented and tested.
First, the convergence of a quantum neural network is compared to a classical neural network.
Second, a quantum convolutional neural network is implemented and tested.
Lastly, the convolutional network is expanded to include mid-circuit measurements.

All simulations were performed on an Apple M1 Pro processor, with the Qiskit \cite{qiskit} and PennyLane \cite{pennylane} frameworks for quantum computing and PyTorch \cite{pytorch} for classical machine learning and optimisation.
Simulating quantum systems is exponentially hard (after all, it prompted the conception of quantum computing in the first place), so the number of qubits is limited.
Only systems of up to around a dozen qubits are easily simulated on consumer-grade hardware.
To what extent the results hence applies to larger systems is hard to say.
