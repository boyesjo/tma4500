\chapter{Simulated comparisons}
\label{chap:comparison}

To see if quantum machine learning is indeed a viable alternative to classical machine learning, some empirical comparisons are in order.
In this chapter, three quantum neural networks are implemented and tested.
First, the convergence of a quantum neural network is compared to a classical neural network.
Second, a quantum convolutional neural network is implemented and tested.
Lastly, the convolutional network is expanded to include mid-circuit measurements.
