\chapter{Quantum computing}
\label{chap:quantum}
The field of quantum computing is split in two main branches: the development of quantum hardware and the study of algorithms that use such hardware.
Only the second branch is relevant for this thesis, and even so only a brief explanation is offered here.
This chapter is primarily based on the Qiskit textbook \cite{qiskit_textbook} and \citetitle{textbook_2nd} by \textcite{textbook_2nd}.
The discussion of variational quantum algorithms in section \ref{sec:vqa} is based on the review by \textcite{cerezo2021}.
