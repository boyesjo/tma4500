\chapter{Quantum computing}
\label{chap:qc}
The field of quantum computing is split into two main branches: the development of quantum hardware and the study of algorithms that use such hardware.
Only the second branch is relevant for this thesis, and even so only a brief explanation is offered here.
This chapter is primarily based on the Qiskit textbook \cite{qiskit_textbook}, \citetitle{textbook_2nd} by \textcite{textbook_2nd} and \citetitle{nielsenchuang} by \textcite{nielsenchuang}.
The discussion of variational quantum algorithms in section \ref{sec:vqa} is based on the review by \textcite{cerezo2021}.
Any reader should have a basic understanding of linear algebra and classical computing.
Knowledge of quantum mechanics is not assumed, albeit certainly helpful.
